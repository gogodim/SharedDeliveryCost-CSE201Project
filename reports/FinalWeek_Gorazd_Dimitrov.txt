This week I woked on merging the WT and non-WT brench, as well as recreating some of the classes in order to easen the merge.
Worked also on testing and debugging, and finally getting to a working prototype.
Currently working on the release i.e. giving instructions for running the project, needed libraries and configurations, as wekk as instructions for testing.
Organized the presentation outline for the whole team, and am now working on some bug fixes and my final report.
