This week I was looking at wt-related issues on Mac. There are still object warnings and we noticed another problem in path-linking (various libraries not included, although they exist in the corresponding directories) and unsuccessfully attempted to solve both problems.

The plan for next week is to work with other mac users to solve both issues, or find an alternative to make wt compatible with the project.
