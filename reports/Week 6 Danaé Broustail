This week I implemented simple functions for the optimization such as match_delivery_cost() 
(for re-distributing shared delivery costs and completing a bucket) and find_and_remove(order) (for deleting an order in buckets).

Next week, I will start laying out the main optimization function structure, linking everything together,
especially the willingness radius intersection, and checking the consistency of the classes and functions with respect to the execution of the algorithm.
