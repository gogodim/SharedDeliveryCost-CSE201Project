Week1 Report
This week I try to built WT libraries on qt on Windows. But it cannot work to me by now.
The way I try first to check if WT can work on different platform like Visual Studio, and it works.
Further, I keep trying on Mingw of Qt, but it cannot work. I build boost for a long time and ,thanks to professor Ali, it finally works.
But now I still dealing with building problems on WT.

If I cannot successfuuly this week, I would change to ubuntu next week, then finished the setting and start making login page of our project.
