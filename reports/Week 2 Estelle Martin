This week I started implementing the distance optimization function which gives the coordinates of the point of livraison depending on the different orders it will
deliver (depending on th eprice of the order made, the point of livraison will be more or less far away from the consumer's place). I send what I did to Leo whith
who I was implementing the function, he should merge on github once done. For the rest of the td I continued working on the user's class for which I encounter issues
that I hope I will be able to overcome next week, and I will then be able to upload it on github.
