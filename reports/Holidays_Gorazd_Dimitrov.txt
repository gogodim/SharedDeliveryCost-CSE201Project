I worked on the Notification Class from start to end, now it's in a working state including the css formating. 
Also worked on merging two out of the 2 front-end parts, now the log-in and the notification are merged and coordinated together to share the DB.
Worked on hashing passwords.
Will work on merging the 3rd front-end part so we can finally merge with the non-wt team.
