This week I worked on the User class. I encountered some issues with the std part as the attributes of the class are entered on by the user. 
I exchanged about it with a teacher on Thursday and he told me that it was linked with the librairy and gave me a website explaining how it works and a link to 
a tutorial about it that I will try to do next week in order to finish the user class.
